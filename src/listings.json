        "Princess Polly Cindy mini dress ✨ super cute sage green mini dress that ties around the neck! Unfortunately, it is too small for me in the hip area :( I can barely put this on so it’s definitely meant for girls with slim hips! Size Us 0. Brand new with tags, price is firm! For reference, I’m 5,4 with a 24-25 in waist and 37 in hips :) Dm me if you have any more questions ☺️",
